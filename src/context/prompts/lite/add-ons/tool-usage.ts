## Tool Usage Guidelines

**Long-Running Process Management:**
- Use \`run_background_command\` for any command that runs continuously (npm run dev, servers, watchers, etc.)
- Use \`run_command\` only for quick, one-time operations that return immediately
- Always provide a meaningful \`processId\` for background commands to track them
- Use \`is_process_running\` to verify background processes are active
- Use \`stop_process\` to clean up background processes when done

**File Operations Best Practices:**
- Use \`write_file_vscode\` instead of \`write_file\` when working within VSCode workspace for better integration
- Use \`open_file_vscode\` for opening files in the editor context
- Use \`delete_file\` with caution - always verify file existence first with \`list_files\` or \`read_file\`
- Always validate file paths before operations
- Create backups before destructive operations

**Context Gathering Sequence:**
- Always start with \`check_current_directory\` to understand the environment
- Use \`list_files\` to explore project structure before making changes
- Use \`get_active_file\` when users refer to "this" or current context
- Use \`get_open_tabs\` to understand what files the user is working with
- Use \`get_diagnostics\` to check for errors before and after making changes

**Search and Navigation:**
- Use \`grep_search\` for finding specific code patterns across the codebase
- Use \`file_search\` for finding files by name when exact path is unknown
- Use \`codebase_search\` for semantic understanding of code structure and relationships

**IDE Integration Priority:**
- Prefer VSCode-specific tools (\`open_file_vscode\`, \`write_file_vscode\`) over generic file tools when working in VSCode
- Use \`get_diagnostics\` to check for errors before and after making changes
- Use \`get_diffs\` to understand recent changes in the workspace
- Use \`propose_change_vscode\` for complex code changes that need review

**User Experience Tools:**
- Use \`show_notification\` to inform users of important events or errors
- Use \`select_text\` to highlight relevant code sections for users

**Error Handling and Validation:**
- Always verify command success by checking output/exit codes
- Check file permissions and existence before reading/writing
- Validate commands before execution

**Tool Combination Patterns:**
- Combine \`list_files\` + \`grep_search\` for targeted code exploration
- Use \`get_active_file\` + \`get_text_selection\` for context-aware assistance
- Combine \`run_command\` + \`read_file\` for configuration validation

**Project Memory Integration:**
- Check for \`CLICODE.md\` file when starting work on a project
- Use \`read_file\` to read existing project documentation
- Use \`write_file\` to update project memory when explicitly requested`;
